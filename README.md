## Comment

During this exercise, I built the components as I would write them while working on a large project.
Due to the lack of specific guidelines, I made the most responsive components so that they look good on as many devices as possible.

## Project structure

This project has the following structure:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components

  â”œâ”€â”€ CityCard
  â””â”€â”€ MealCard
â””â”€â”€ theme

```
