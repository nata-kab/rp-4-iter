# Exercise 4 Iterators

## Exercise description

Build and style any two components as React.js components (pick appropriate free to use photos and fonts). Upload results to a website like surge.sh, netlify, etc.

Pick component designs from this repository.

## Comment

- During this exercise, I built the components as in a complex project.

- Due to the lack of specific guidelines, I created the components as responsive as possible to look good on different screens and mobile devices.
- I used calculated rem with vw units to scale every time the user changes their preferred browser font size. At the same time, this solution makes the layout fluid.
- I chose to use images instead of background images due to make images perceivable to customers with low vision or blind.
