# Exercise 4 Iterators

## Exercise description

Build and style any two components as React.js components (pick appropriate free to use photos and fonts). Upload results to a website like surge.sh, netlify, etc.

Pick component designs from this repository.

## Comment

During this exercise, I built the components as I would write them while working on a large project.

Due to the lack of specific guidelines, I created the components as responsive as possible to look good on as many devices as possible. I used a calculated rem with vw units to scale every time the user changes their preferred browser font size and at the same time make the layout fluid.
